I developed a web app that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to 
perform sentiment analysis on user input. By leveraging the ParallelDots API,
we were able to accurately analyze text and determine the underlying sentiment behind it.
The web app was designed with an intuitive user interface, allowing users to easily input text and receive real-time sentiment analysis results. 
Whether users were analyzing product reviews, movies review
or other types of text, our app provided valuable insights that could inform decision-making and help drive business success.
